Service Oriented Architecture, Single Page Web Apps, JSON APIs, all of the big buzz words. I love all of them. I spend my days building these types of systems for my clients. That's why when I started working on my side project startup with a friend we chose Go, Angular, and SOA. We were going to build this application "the right way".

So why, if you go to the site now, is it a single Rails monolith with full page refreshes and almost no JavaScript? That's an excellent question, and the subject of this talk.

During this talk we'll look at how I started building my application "correctly" and ended up with the classic monolith architecture you hear people warning against. We'll talk about why Go, SOA, and Angular were all the wrong choices for this app, and why the monolith was the right answer.

Along the way you might learn something or two about making the correct architectual choices for your organization, at the very least you'll hear some funny stories about my pain and a few choice animated GIFs as well.
