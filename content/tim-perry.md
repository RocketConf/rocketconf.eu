It's tough to truly understand and get started with microservices until you've seen them in practice, looked at the challenges and benefits up close, and seen how they fit into different use cases.

In this talk we'll look at microservice pipeline architecture, taking a deep look inside the content pipeline powering BBC Newsbeat, a fully microservice-based news site we developed recently. We'll examine the architecture, tools and processes that make this effective, the benefits microservices provide in domains like these, and our solutions to the new challenges microservices can bring, to give you a deeper understanding of exactly how you can put microservices to work in practice.
