Jet Propulsion Laboratory — a scientific institution making a lot of research and development for NASA. Their portfolio includes such famous missons as Curiosity Mars rover and Voyager probe which left solar system after 25 years of flight and still providing scientific information. As a result of JPL amazing experience a set of code guidelines was developed and published recently.
