As web developers we treat mobile phones as scaled down desktops. We like responsive design and nice looking buttons. But we can do so much more! That little device in your pocket is equipped with a gazillion sensors, and thus able to connect with the real life. Why not exploit that? It’s time to do crazy stuff with phones!

In a talk that is filled with demos, Jan will throw phones in the air, create a theremin, tag people with beacons, generate live music, rip some phones apart, play with the gyroscope and maybe even do some juggling. And all of that... with JavaScript.
