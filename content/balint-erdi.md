Ember.js is a client-side application framework, but it is not just _a_ client-side application framework. Its features (and guiding principles) include routing as a core concept, convention over configuration and the latest, stability without stagnation.

As it quickly approaches 2.0, all that could be considered shortcomings fall by the wayside. It probably has the best tooling for building and developing Ember apps (Ember CLI) and its new view engine (HTMLBars & Glimmer) will definitely make the performance worries a thing of the past.

Above that, Ember is especially suited for developing large applications by multiple, or quickly changing teams. Due to its opinionatedness, there is more often than not a "one true way" of doing things which means that developers can quickly get familiar with Ember projects and the "time to first contribution" is low.

The existence of "the Ember way" eliminates trivial decisions that we, developers, face dozens of times every day and lets us focus on meaningful questions.

In the talk, I'd talk about Ember's features and fortes with a focus on what makes it a perfect tool for building ambitious web apps.
