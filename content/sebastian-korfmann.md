You had an idea, built a prototype — the agile way — and even shipped it. It has full test coverage, utilises design patterns all over the place and is ready to be torn apart into microservices. In a nutshell: It's a technical masterpiece.

However, the project isn't skyrocketing, hardly anybody cares at all. By no means what you were picturing when it was a precious idea in your mind. Let's face it, shipping an application is not even half the battle of building a successful product.

In this talk, we'll take a journey through the past decade of my life, where I kicked off about a dozen side projects. While each of them had different goals, they all had one thing in common: born in a gilded cage and never had to learn to fly. Let's find out how to avoid this "pet project trap" from the get-go and how it made all the difference for my current venture.
