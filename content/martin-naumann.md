When building web applications nowadays, there's a lot of fiddling and frustration involved. There's also the notorious problem of cross-browser support for new web standards, be it new input elements or new APIs - most of the time you'll end up having to hand-stitch some sort of coating around it to make it work decently.

But that's about to change — as of today. Browsers start shipping an exciting set of web standards, summed up under the term "Web Components".

In this talk we'll have a close look at what problems they're solving and how they're set out to do so. There's going to be many live demonstrations of how they work and how you can start using them today for your web applications.
