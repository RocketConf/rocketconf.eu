        <h2>Awesome! You're here!</h2>
        <p>
            This November we will bring you <strong>RocketConf</strong>, a three-day
            developer conference for the modern web developer and dev ops who loves writing
            beautiful code and creating magnificent things that matter.
        </p>

        <p>
            RocketConf does not focus on any particual technology or tool. We believe that
            you can learn more from people with a different perspective. Technical topics can
            range from Ruby on Rails to Ember.js to Elixir to Docker and everything in between.
        </p>

        <p>
            To learn something well, you should get hands-on experience. On the 11th November
            we'll host workshops where you can get together with others and get a real
            learning experience by <em>doing</em> something fun.
            The 12th and 13th November are reserved for the conference talks.
        </p>
